## Hi, I'm Justin Li ðŸ‘‹

When I wrote my first Python script, I became interested in programming and started building projects to see what I could create.
Iâ€™m currently working on a full-stack project to understand how all the parts of a system fit together.

- I'm currently reading **Writing An Interpreter In Go** by Thorsten Ball.
